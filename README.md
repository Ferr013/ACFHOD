# ACFHOD (Angular Correlation Function with Halo Occupation Distribution)

``ACFHOD`` is a software package to calculate the angular correlation function using the HOD formalism.

Installation
------------
Create a conda environment with `python == 3.9`, activate it and then run

``pip install git+https://github.com/Ferr013/ACFHOD``

P.S. You might encounter some installation issues on recent Apple architectures
due to the Fortran compilers called by the required external libraries.
I suggest to install the library on a Linux server whenever possible.
